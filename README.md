# Binary Search Tree

## Operations

1. `Insert(key)` - inserts a new node intro the binary tree.
2. `Remove(key)` - removes existing node from the binary tree.
3. `Search(key)` - searches for the node with a specified key value.
4. `Traverse(algorithm)` - traverses a binary tree using an algorithm (In-order, Pre-order, Post-order, BFS, DFS).
